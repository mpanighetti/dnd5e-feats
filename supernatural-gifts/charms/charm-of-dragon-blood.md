# Charm of Dragon Blood

The evil dragon god Tiamat has granted you a boon, channeling her divine energy directly into your bloodstream. Your veins pulse with a faint orange glow of infernal fire, and you are now considered to have dragon blood, granting you draconic ancestry for the purpose of any effect which requires this trait (if you did not already have draconic ancestry).

Additionally, you can temporarily anoint a vehicle's weapon or movement component with fresh blood shed from a creature with dragon blood, including but not limited to: dragons, kobolds, and any creature with draconic ancestry (including yourself). To anoint a vehicle component, as an action, either you or a creature targeting you must spill the dragon blood on the component by making a weapon attack that deals slashing damage against an eligible creature. This attack automatically hits willing creatures.

While a vehicle component is anointed in this manner, the vehicle gains the following special traits:

- Anointed vehicle weapons and movement components can function without dedicated crew members, instead operating autonomously and taking vehicle actions in response to your telepathic commands (no action required).
- If a vehicle with an anointed helm has functioning sails, it can move up to its maximum sailing speed as if it is always sailing with the wind.
- Anointed vehicle weapon attacks are magical.

An anointed vehicle component trait only functions while you are within 30 feet of the anointed component and are not incapacitated. Each component remains anointed for 8 hours, until the ship or the component is destroyed, or until the dragon blood is removed by any means, after which the magic fades until more dragon blood is shed. This charm vanishes from you when you die.
