# Charm of the Depths

_Supernatural Gift (Charm)_

Rows of gashes appear on the sides of your neck forming fishlike gills, and the skin between your fingers and toes (or equivalent digits) grows into webbing. These changes grant you the following traits:

- You gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.
- You gain the ability to breathe water through your gills.
- While you are submerged completely underwater, you have Darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.

This charm vanishes from you when you die.
