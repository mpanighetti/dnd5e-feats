# Beastlands Touched

_Origin Feat_

You have an innate connection to the plane of beasts. This connection could come from being born in or having long resided in the Beastlands, or could have been granted by magical means, such as intervention from a deity or other entity that resides in the Beastlands. You gain the following benefits.

_**Keen Hearing and Smell.**_ You gain Advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell.

_**Natural Weapons.**_ You can use natural features, such as your bite or claws, to make Unarmed Strikes. Choose between Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage. When you use your Unarmed Strike to deal damage with the features, it deals 1d6 damage of the type you chose when selecting this feat instead of dealing the normal damage for your Unarmed Strike.

_**Channel Beastlands.**_ As a Magic action, you can magically channel your innate animal connection to temporarily gain a special movement speed equal to your walking speed and corresponding secondary benefits, choosing from the options below each time you use this action. If you already have the selected special movement from another source, you instead add 10 feet to that movement speed. Each special movement speed and secondary benefits last for a duration specified alongside the option:

- **Burrowing Speed (10 Minutes).** You gain Tremorsense to a distance of 30 feet, and you can Dash as a Bonus Action while burrowing.
- **Climbing Speed (1 Hour).** You have Advantage on Strength checks, and you have Advantage on Saving Throws made to land on your feet when falling.
- **Flying Speed (1 Minute).** You can Disengage as a Bonus Action.
- **Swimming Speed (1 Hour).** You gain the ability to breathe underwater and you have Advantage on Constitution Saving Throws.

After you channel your animal connection in this manner, you regain the ability to do so when you finish a Long Rest.
