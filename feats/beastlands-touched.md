# Beastlands Touched

_1st-Level Background Feat_

- **Prerequisite:** None
- **Repeatable:** No

You have an innate connection to the plane of beasts. This connection could come from being born in or having long resided in the Beastlands, or could have been granted by magical means, such as intervention from a deity or other entity that resides in the Beastlands. This connection grants you the following benefits:

- You either gain Darkvision to a distance of 60 feet, or you gain advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell or hearing (choose one when you select this feat).
- You can use natural features, such as your bite or claws, to make Unarmed Strikes. When you hit with them, the strike deals 1d6 + your Strength modifier damage (choosing from Bludgeoning, Piercing, or Slashing damage when you select this feat), instead of the normal Unarmed Strike damage.
- As a Bonus Action, you can magically channel your innate animal connection to temporarily gain a special movement speed equal to your walking speed and a corresponding secondary benefit, choosing from the options below; if you already have the selected special movement from another source, you instead temporarily add 10 feet to that movement speed:

  - **Climbing Speed.** You have Advantage on Strength checks, and you have Advantage on Saving Throws made to land on your feet when falling.
  - **Burrowing Speed.** You gain Tremorsense to a distance of 30 feet, and you can Dash as a bonus action while burrowing.
  - **Swimming Speed.** You gain the ability to breathe underwater and you have Advantage on Constitution Saving Throws.
  - **Flying Speed.** You can Disengage as a Bonus Action.

  This channeling lasts for 10 minutes or until you end it as a Bonus Action. Once you perform this channeling, you can't do so again until you finish a Long Rest.
